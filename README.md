# Aim - Tools for EDA - Study of Numpy Library

# Theory:-

Array Creation: Demonstrates how to create NumPy arrays from Python lists (np.array()).  
n.dim: The number of dimensions (axes) of the array (e.g., 1 for a vector, 2 for a matrix).  
n.size: The total number of elements in the array.  
n.shape: A tuple indicating the size of the array in each dimension.  
dtype: The data type of the elements in the array (e.g., int64, float64).  
np.zeros((rows, cols)): Creates an array filled with zeros.  
np.ones((rows, cols)): Creates an array filled with ones.  
np.eye(size): Creates an identity matrix (a square matrix with ones on the main diagonal and zeros elsewhere).  
np.arange(start, stop, step): Generates an array with evenly spaced values within a given interval (similar to Python's range()).  
np.linspace(start, stop, num): Generates an array with a specified number of evenly spaced values over a given interval.  
Basic Array Operations: NumPy arrays support vectorized operations, meaning operations are applied element-wise without explicit loops, leading to significant performance gains.  
Scalar*Matrix: (b*2).  
np.mean(): Calculates the arithmetic mean of array elements.  
np.median(): Calculates the median of array elements.  
np.sum(): Calculates the sum of array elements.  
np.max(): Finds the maximum value in the array.  
np.min(): Finds the minimum value in the array.  


# Conclusion:-
This experiment provides a foundational understanding of how to use NumPy for basic array manipulation and statistical computations, which are essential first steps in any data analysis workflow.
